<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Azeez, a Service Desk Engineer living in Manchester, UK, and an aspiring Full Stack Developer. With a background in IT support, I've gained valuable experience troubleshooting and solving complex problems. However, my passion for technology has led me to pursue a career in web development, where I'm learning to build both the front and back ends of modern, dynamic websites.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm sharpening my coding skills through hands-on projects and courses, working towards creating efficient, user-friendly applications. I'm excited to combine my problem-solving abilities with development to craft seamless digital experiences. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
